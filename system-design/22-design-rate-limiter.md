# 22. Design a Rate Limiter

A rate limiter says "no" to too many requests. It's the seatbelt of an API. Every public service has one. If you don't, somebody will scrape you, brute-force you, or accidentally DDoS you with a buggy script.

We covered the algorithms in Chapter 09. This chapter is about turning those algorithms into a real distributed service.

## Clarify

| Question                      | Example answer                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Per user, IP, or API key?     | API key (paid plan) and IP (anonymous), with different limits |
| Same limit for all endpoints? | No — `POST /login` is stricter than `GET /products`           |
| What happens when limited?    | Return HTTP 429 with `Retry-After` header                     |
| Soft or hard limit?           | Hard. No grace overage                                        |
| Where does it run?            | Edge (API gateway) and per-service for sensitive endpoints    |

## Estimate

- **Active users:** 10M
- **Requests per second peak:** 100K
- **Rules:** ~50 different limit configs

The rate-limiter call itself must be fast. If the limit check costs 50 ms, you've doubled API latency. Target: **under 1 ms** for the hit/miss decision.

## High-level design

```
[ client ]
    |
    v
[ Load balancer ]
    |
    v
+---------------------+
|  API gateway        |
|  - reads rule set   |
|  - calls limiter    |
+---------+-----------+
          |
          v
   +-------------+
   |   Redis     |   counts per key, per window
   +-------------+
          ^
          | rules synced from
   +-------------+
   |  Postgres   |   source of truth for limit configs
   +-------------+
```

The gateway calls Redis on every request. Redis is the only thing on the hot path. Rules live in Postgres and are reloaded into the gateway every few seconds.

## Deep dive 1: Picking an algorithm

From Chapter 09, the four common algorithms:

| Algorithm              | Pros                           | Cons                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Fixed window           | Simple, one counter per window | Spikes at window boundaries |
| Sliding window log     | Most accurate                  | Memory grows with traffic   |
| Sliding window counter | Good balance, ~exact           | A bit more math             |
| Token bucket           | Allows bursts, smooth refill   | Two values to track         |

For most APIs, **token bucket** wins. It's what AWS, Stripe, and GitHub use. Bursts are friendly to clients, the refill rate caps long-term abuse, and the math is two numbers.

```python
def allow(key, capacity, refill_per_sec):
    now = time.time()
    tokens, last = redis.hmget(key, "tokens", "last")
    tokens = float(tokens or capacity)
    last = float(last or now)
    tokens = min(capacity, tokens + (now - last) * refill_per_sec)
    if tokens >= 1:
        redis.hmset(key, {"tokens": tokens - 1, "last": now})
        return True
    redis.hmset(key, {"tokens": tokens, "last": now})
    return False
```

To stay atomic under load, run this as a Lua script inside Redis. One round-trip, no race.

## Deep dive 2: Where to run it

**Three layers, three trade-offs.**

1. **Edge / CDN / API gateway.** Cheapest to run. Stops bad traffic before it hits your servers. Good for blanket per-IP limits.
2. **Service mesh / sidecar.** Per-service rules. Useful when one team's hot endpoint shouldn't sink another's.
3. **In the app.** Most flexible (you know the user and the business rule). Most expensive (your app paid for the request already).

Real systems do all three.

## Deep dive 3: Failure modes

What if Redis is down?

- **Fail open:** allow the request through. Risk: you got DDoSed during the outage.
- **Fail closed:** reject everything. Risk: your own outage just became user-visible.

Best practice: **fail open at the edge, fail closed for sensitive endpoints** (login, password reset, payment). Log every fail-open event loudly so you know it happened.

What if Redis returns stale numbers across regions? Token bucket tolerates this well — you're slightly more permissive across regions but never wildly off.

## Response shape

Always tell the client what happened. Don't just drop the connection.

```
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Retry-After: 13
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1710000000

{ "error": "rate_limited", "retry_after_seconds": 13 }
```

Clients with exponential backoff (Chapter 09) will recover gracefully.

## Things to remember

- Rate limiting protects against accidents, abuse, and bad clients alike. It is not optional.
- Token bucket is the default. Implement it as a Lua script inside Redis.
- Run limiters at multiple layers; tune at the edge for cheap blanket rules and in the app for business logic.
- Always include `Retry-After` and remaining-quota headers.
- Decide fail-open vs fail-closed per endpoint, not globally.

# 06. HTTP

HTTP is the language web servers speak. Browsers, mobile apps, microservices, scrapers, IoT devices — all of them speak some flavor of HTTP. If you know one protocol cold, this is the one.

## A request is just text

Strip away the abstraction. An HTTP request is plain text over a TCP connection. Here's one:

```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: curl/8.0.1
Accept: */*

```

That's it. A method, a path, a protocol version, some headers, a blank line, and optionally a body.

The response is also text:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1256

<html><body>...</body></html>
```

You can do it by hand:

```bash
# Open a TCP connection and type the request yourself
nc example.com 80
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

# (press enter twice)
```

You'll see the response come back. That's all HTTP is, under the polish.

## Methods (verbs)

You probably know the main ones:

| Method  | Meaning                    | Has body?   | Cached? |
| ------- | -------------------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| GET     | Fetch a resource           | Usually not | Yes     |
| POST    | Create / submit            | Yes         | No      |
| PUT     | Replace a resource         | Yes         | No      |
| PATCH   | Partial update             | Yes         | No      |
| DELETE  | Remove a resource          | Sometimes   | No      |
| HEAD    | Like GET but no body       | No          | Yes     |
| OPTIONS | Ask what's allowed (CORS)  | No          | No      |

A clean REST API uses these verbs predictably:

```
GET    /users          -> list users
GET    /users/42       -> get user 42
POST   /users          -> create a user
PUT    /users/42       -> replace user 42
PATCH  /users/42       -> partial update
DELETE /users/42       -> delete user 42
```

## Status codes

Three-digit numbers grouped by hundred:

| Range | Meaning | Common |
|---|---|---|
| 1xx | Informational | 101 (switching protocols, for WebSockets) |
| 2xx | Success | 200 OK, 201 Created, 204 No Content |
| 3xx | Redirect | 301 (moved permanently), 302 (temp), 304 (not modified) |
| 4xx | Client error | 400 (bad request), 401 (not authenticated), 403 (forbidden), 404 (not found), 429 (rate limited) |
| 5xx | Server error | 500 (internal), 502 (bad gateway), 503 (overloaded), 504 (gateway timeout) |

A useful mental model:
- **2xx**: I did what you asked.
- **3xx**: Try over there.
- **4xx**: You messed up.
- **5xx**: I messed up.

## Headers

Headers are metadata. Most of what makes HTTP interesting is in the headers.

Common request headers:

```
Host: example.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOi...
Cookie: session=abc123
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 ...
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
```

Common response headers:

```
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: max-age=3600, public
Set-Cookie: session=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
ETag: "deadbeef"
```

The `Cache-Control` and `ETag` ones are how browsers and CDNs decide what to cache. The `Authorization` header is how you authenticate. The CORS headers (`Access-Control-...`) are how browsers decide whether to even let JavaScript see the response.

## HTTPS in one paragraph

HTTPS is HTTP over TLS. TLS does two things: it encrypts the connection (no one on the path can read it), and it authenticates the server (you know you're talking to the real example.com, not a man-in-the-middle).

The cost is a handshake on top of the TCP handshake. For HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 that's a few hundred ms on a cold connection. HTTP/3 over QUIC eliminates most of it.

Everyone uses HTTPS now. Browsers mark HTTP sites as insecure. Get a free cert from Let's Encrypt and move on.

## HTTP versions briefly

| Version | Year | Highlight |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP/1.0 | 1996 | One request per connection |
| HTTP/1.1 | 1997 | Persistent connections, pipelining |
| HTTP/2 | 2015 | Multiplexed streams, header compression, binary framing |
| HTTP/3 | 2022 | QUIC (over UDP), no head-of-line blocking, faster handshake |

For most apps it doesn't matter. The framework and CDN handle this for you. If you're optimizing real performance, HTTP/2 vs HTTP/3 matters at the edges.

## Code: making and serving HTTP

Making a request in Python:

```python
import requests

r = requests.get("https://api.github.com/users/octocat")
print(r.status_code)        # 200
print(r.headers["x-ratelimit-remaining"])
print(r.json()["name"])
```

A minimal server with Flask:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

users = {}

@app.get("/users/<int:uid>")
def get_user(uid):
    if uid not in users:
        return {"error": "not found"}, 404
    return jsonify(users[uid])

@app.post("/users")
def create_user():
    data = request.get_json()
    uid = len(users) + 1
    users[uid] = data
    return jsonify({"id": uid, **data}), 201

app.run(port=8000)
```

Try it:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Ada"}'

curl http://localhost:8000/users/1
```

Notice how cleanly REST maps to HTTP. `POST /users` creates. `GET /users/1` reads. Status codes carry meaning. The server returns 404 for missing, 201 for created. That's the whole point of REST: use HTTP the way it was designed.

## Idempotency (the underrated concept)

A method is **idempotent** if doing it twice has the same effect as doing it once.

- GET, PUT, DELETE: idempotent.
- POST: not idempotent.

This matters because networks are unreliable. If your client sends a POST and times out, you can't safely retry — you might charge the card twice. But a PUT? Safe to retry.

In production you handle this with **idempotency keys**: the client sends a unique ID with the request, the server stores it, and if it sees the same key twice, it ignores the second one. Stripe's API is built on this.

```
POST /payments
Idempotency-Key: abc-123-unique-id
```

## Caching basics

HTTP has built-in cache headers. The two big ones:

```
Cache-Control: max-age=3600          # cache for 1 hour
Cache-Control: no-store              # don't cache at all
Cache-Control: private, max-age=300  # only cache for one user
```

And conditional caching with ETag or Last-Modified:

```
# First request
GET /image.jpg
-> 200 OK, ETag: "abc"

# Later, browser asks "is it still abc?"
GET /image.jpg
If-None-Match: "abc"
-> 304 Not Modified   (no body, save bandwidth)
```

We'll go deeper in the Caching and CDN chapters.

## Things to remember

- HTTP is text over TCP. Read a few raw requests and it stops feeling abstract.
- Methods have meaning. GET reads, POST creates, PUT replaces, DELETE deletes.
- Status codes group meaning by the hundreds: 2xx good, 4xx your fault, 5xx my fault.
- Headers carry the metadata: auth, caching, content type, CORS.
- HTTPS is HTTP + TLS. Use it everywhere.
- Idempotent methods are safe to retry. Non-idempotent need idempotency keys.
